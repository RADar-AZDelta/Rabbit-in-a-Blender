===========

**Rabbit in a Blender** is an [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) pipeline [CLI](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line-interface) to transform your [EMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record) data to [OMOP](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/the-common-data-model/).

Why the name 'Rabbit in a Blender'? It stays in the rabbit theme of the [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org) tools, and an ETL pipeline is like putting all your data in a blender. 

No rabbits were harmed during the development of this tool!

Introduction
============

Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes are very complex and are mainly crafted by highly skilled data engineers. The process of transforming the electronic medical record (EMR) data into the observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) is no exception. The mapping process of the source values to standard concepts is mostly done by subject matter experts, who lack the knowledge of programming the ETL process. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could drastically simplify the ETL process, so that you don’t need seasoned data engineers to start the OMOP CDM journey. Imagine that you just save your queries, Usagi comma separated value (CSV) text files and custom concept CSV’s on disk, and run a command line interface (CLI) tool that does all the ETL magic automatically. 


Concept
=======

The main strength of the CDM is its simplified scheme. This scheme is a relational data model, where each table has a primary key and can have foreign keys to other tables. Because of the relational data model, we can extract the dependencies of the tables from the scheme. For example, the provider table is dependent on the care_site table, which is in its turn dependent on the location table. If we flatten that dependency graph, we have a sequence of ETL steps that we need to follow to have consistent data in our OMOP CDM. These ETL steps can be automated, so a hospital can focus its resources on the queries and the mapping of the concepts. The automated ETL consists of multiple tasks. It needs to execute queries, add custom concepts, apply the Usagi source to concept mapping, and do a lot of housekeeping. An example of that housekeeping is the autonumbering of the OMOP CDM primary keys, for which the ETL process needs to maintain a swap table that holds the key of the source table and the generated sequential number of the CDM table’s primary key. Another example of the housekeeping is the upload and processing of the Usagi CSV’s and also the upload and parsing of the custom concept CSV’s. In an ETL process data is divided in zones (cfr. the [zones in a data lake](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-enterprise-big/9781491931547/ch01.html#zones_of_a_typical_data_lake)). The raw zone holds the source data (for example the data from the EMR), the work zone holds all the house keeping tables of the ETL process and the gold zone holds our final OMOP CDM.
After designing the architecture, the implementation needs to be developed. We have two options to choose from: configuration and convention as design paradigm. We choose convention over configuration, because it decreases the number of decisions the user has to make and eliminates the complexity. As convention a specific folder structure is adopted (see [our mappings as example](https://github.com/RADar-AZDelta/AZDelta-OMOP-CDM)). A folder is created for each OMOP CDM table, where the SQL queries are stored to fill up the specific CDM table. In the table folders we also have for each concept column a sub folder. Those concept column sub folders hold our Usagi CSV’s (files ending with _usagi.csv). We also have a custom folder in the concept column sub folder, that holds the custom concept CSV’s (files ending with _concept.csv). With this convention in place, our ETL CLI tool has everything it needs to do its magic.
One final requirement we want to build in the ETL CLI tool, is that each ETL step is an atomic operation, it either fails or succeeds, so that there is no possibility to corrupt the final OMOP CDM data.

Notes on Use
============

You will need to run the cleanup command when concept mappings change in your existing Usagi CSV's. The cleanup is not necessary when you add new queries or add additional Usagi mappings.

The measurement table has the **measurement_event_id** field, the observation table has the **observation_event_id** field, the cost table has the **cost_event_id** field, the episode_event table has the **event_id** field and the fact_relationship table has the **fact_id_1** and **fact_id_2** fields. All those fields are foreign keys to almost all OMOP CMD tables. Put the source id in the event_id field and the reffered table in the field_concept_id field. An example of how to implement this in the sql-file:
- Linking two people with a personal relationship in the fact_relationship table:
```sql
select distinct
  'person' as domain_concept_id_1  -- foreign table name as string
  ,pr.person_nr_1 as fact_id_1	-- same key as used as when adding the person to the person table
  ,'person' as domain_concept_id_2  -- foreign table name as string	
  ,pr.person_nr_1 as fact_id_2	-- same key as used as when adding the person to the person table
  ,pr.relationship as relationship_concept_id  -- column with sourceCodes specifying the relationship and mapped in a _usagi.csv file in the relationship_concept_id folder
from person_relationships pr
```

The **custom concepts** get added to the **source_to_concept_map** table. The concept_code is used as the source_code, the newly assigned (>2.000.000.000) concept_id is used as the target_concept_id. The custom concepts are also added to the **usagi table**, using the concept_code as sourceCode and the newly assigned concept_id as the conceptId. The custom concepts can be used **as mapping targets** in two ways:
- No explicit mapping in usagi table: the source code (as assigned in your ETL sql file) is mapped to the custom concept where it equals the concept_code
- Explicit mapping in usagi: map a sourceCode in the usagi table to a custom concept by setting its targetConceptId equal to the concept_code of the custom concept.

Examples:

* mapping "Cemiplimab", with source_code *M1*:
    - Add custom concept for cemiplimab with concept_code = *M1*, it gets a assigned a concept_id automatically, no usagi-entry required
    - Optionally add an usagi-entry for clarity, mapping sourceCode = *M1* to targetConceptId = *M1*, the concept_id gets filled in automatically
* mapping "Atezolizumab + Cemiplimab", with source_code *C12*:
    - Add custom concept for cemiplimab with concept_code = *M1*, it gets a assigned a concept_id automatically
    - Add two usagi-entries: mapping sourceCode *C12* to targetConceptId = *1792776* (standard code for atezolizumab) and to targetConceptId = *M1*
    
    ALTERNATIVELY:

    - Add custom concept for cemiplimab with concept_code = *C12*, it gets a assigned a concept_id automatically, no usagi-entry required
    - Add only one usagi-entry, mapping sourceCode *C12* to targetConceptId = *1792776* (standard code for atezolizumab), the second mapping of *C12* to custom concept with concept_code = *C12* is done automatically.

For the moment we only implemented a BigQuery backend for the ETL process, because this is what our hospital uses. Other database technologies as ETL backend can be implemented.
A SQL Server backend is in development for usage in the Federated Health Innovation Network (FHIN) project.

ETL flow
========

Most CDM tables have foreign keys (FKs) to other tables. Some tables can be processed in parallel by the ETL engine, because they have no FKs dependencies between them, others have to be processed in a specific order.

The ETL flow for v5.4 is as follows:

```
├──cdm_source
├──cost
├──fact_relationship
├──location
├──metadata
└──vocabulary
  └──care_site
    └──provider
      └──person
        ├──condition_era
        ├──death
        ├──dose_era
        ├──drug_era
        ├──episode
        ├──observation_period
        ├──payer_plan_period
        ├──specimen
        └──visit_occurrence
          ├──episode_event
          └──visit_detail
            ├──condition_occurrence
            ├──device_exposure
            ├──drug_exposure
            ├──measurement
            ├──note
            ├──observation
            └──procedure_occurrence
              └──note_nlp
```

Because the event FKs (e.g. observation_event_id, cost_event_id, measurement_event_id, etc.), can point to almost any table, the event FK's are processed in a second, seperate ETL step.

Install python
========
usage of [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install the required version of python (version 3.12)

```
pyenv install 3.12
```

Installation
========

```bash
pip install Rabbit-in-a-Blender
```

Config
========

With the addition of additional database engines, we switched to a [ini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) config file for database specific configurations.
This makes the CLI arguments less cumbersome.

RiaB searches for the ini config file by using the following cascade:
1. CLI --config argument
2. RIAB_CONFIG environment variable (the RIAB_CONFIG environment variable can also be placed in a .env file in the current folder)
3. riab.ini in the current folder

Below an example of a config:

```ini
[riab]
db_engine=bigquery

[bigquery]
credentials_file=service_account.json
; Optional
; The credentials file must be a service account key, stored authorized user credentials, external account credentials, or impersonated service account credentials. (see https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/reference/google.auth.html#google.auth.load_credentials_from_file)
; Alternatively, you can also use 'Application Default Credentials' (ADC) (see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login)
location=EU
; Location where to run the BigQuery jobs. Must match the location of the datasets used in the query. (important for GDPR)
project_raw=my_omop_project
; Optional
; Can be handy if you use jinja templates for your ETL queries (ex if you are using development-staging-production environments). Must have the following format: PROJECT_ID
dataset_work=my_omop_project.work
; The dataset that will hold RiaB's housekeeping tables. Must have the following format: PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID
dataset_omop=my_omop_project.omop
; The dataset that will hold the OMOP tables. Must have the following format: PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID
dataset_dqd=my_omop_project.dqd
; The dataset that will hold the data quality tables. Must have the following format: PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID
dataset_achilles=my_omop_project.achilles
; The dataset that will hold the data achilles tables. Must have the following format: PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID
bucket=gs://my_omop_bucket/upload
; The Cloud Storage bucket uri, that will hold the uploaded Usagi and custom concept files. (the uri has format 'gs://{bucket_name}/{bucket_path}')

[sql_server]
server=127.0.0.1
; The SQL Server host
port=1433
; The SQL Server port (defaults to 1433)
user=sa
; The SQL Server user
password=?????

BigQuery
========

There are 2 ways to [authenticate](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) with GCP:
* Use a [Service Account key file](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) with **--google-credentials-file** cli option
* When developing or testing you can use [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login)

    [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk#installing_the_latest_version) the gcloud CLI!

    For example for windows run the folowing powershell script:
    ```powershell
    (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe", "$env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe")
    & $env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe
    ```

    Authenticate:
    ```bash
    # login
    gcloud auth application-default login
    # set our project
    PROJECT_ID="our_omop_etl_project_id_on_GCP" #you need to change this
    gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}
    # you can alternatively set the project_id with a environment variable
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=${PROJECT_ID}
    ```

    More info can also be found in the [Python API for GCP authentication](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/1.19.1/auth.html#overview)

The creation of different datasets in needed before config settings.

SQL Server
==========

## Prerequisites

RiaB has a dependency on the [BCP utility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/bcp-utility) to upload the CSV's to SQL Server.

Add the BCP dependency to the PATH environment variable.

Install bcp on machine that will run RIAB:

1. Go to website [bcp utility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/bcp-utility?view=sql-server-ver16)
2. Download ODBC driver (x64) and command line util (x64) for windows
3. Install both
4. Restart machine, to update PATH environment variables

A check on the correct installation of BCP via run on the same terminal als RiAB runs: 
```
bcp.exe --version
```
## Steps Python

1. (Opt.) Create python virtual environment
2. Open terminal (in virtual environment)
3. Install RIAB package:
    > pip install Rabbit-in-a-Blender --no-cache-dir

## Steps SQL

The creation of different schemes (work, omop, dqd, achilles) is needed.
Filling in the config, SQL user requires the [db_ddladmin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles?view=sql-server-ver16) role (see line user=sa; The SQL Server user).

1. Ensure SQL allows non- Entra ID users
   1. Open Azure portal
   2. Go to SQL **server** instance (not database)
   3. Under settings, make sure "Support only Microsoft Entra authentication for this server" is **NOT** checked.
2. Connect to Azure SQL Database as an admin
3. Create SQL User for riab to use
    > CREATE USER fhin_riab WITH password='...TODO...';
    >
    > GO
    >
    > EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', 'fhin_riab';
    >
    > EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datawriter', 'fhin_riab';
    >
    > EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_ddladmin', 'fhin_riab';
4. Create schemas for riab
    > CREATE SCHEMA raw;
    >
    > GO
    >
    > CREATE SCHEMA work;
    >
    > GO
    >
    > CREATE SCHEMA omop;
    >
    > GO
    >
    > CREATE SCHEMA dqd;
    >
    > GO
    >
    > CREATE SCHEMA achilles;
    >
    > GO

## Steps RIAB

As explained above and here as a summary

1. Create riab.ini file 
2. Open terminal (in virtual python env)
3. Change dir to folder where riab.ini exists
4. Create omop database
    > riab --create-db
5. Create vocabs
    > riab --import-vocabularies ./vocabulary-2022-07-28.zip
6. Create the ETL folder structure
    > riab --create-folders ./OMOP_CDM
7. Run ETL
8. Cleanup tables
9. Data quality check
